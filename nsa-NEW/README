What sort of input do we need?

- Invite the bot to a channel
    https://maclawran.slack.com/ - 
    Update the local hash table with GROUPID:GROUPNAME
    create channel WITH THE SAME NAME AS THE URL /maclawran/messages/ABABABABA

    When it receives a message from slack, lookup the GROUPID from the hash table
    i.e (XYXYXY -> general -> publish to maclawran/messages/ABABABAABA)

- Other slack invites the bot to their channel
    Same as above with different name: other/general

- tell NSA to link to a remote channel
    @nsa link https://other.slack.com/general
    subscribes to this channel and passes incoming messages to slack/generalA

- tell NSA to unlink a remote channel
  @nsa unlink channel

PERMISSIONS
    EITHER A SHARED SECRET OR A CHECKLIST

LIMITS
    YOU CAN LINK AS MANY AS YOU WANT BUT ONLY THE FIRST INSTANCE WILL BE FOUND
    (THERE ARE DUPLICATES IN THE QUEUE)

    TECHNICALLY THERE'S NO REASON WE COULDN'T HAVE MULTIPLE CHANNELS ATTACHED TO A SINGLE CHANNEL
    THIS MAY OR MAY NOT WORK - NEED TO CHECK
    ALL WE'D REALLY HAVE TO DO IS LOOP THROUGH THE RESULTS AND ADD SUBSCRIPTIONS

    @nsa link URL
    @nsa unlink URL
    @nsa show-links
